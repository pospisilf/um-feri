## üöÄ Application Implementation

### Core Application
The project includes a simple Express.js web application that demonstrates basic functionality while intentionally including vulnerable dependencies for security testing purposes.

## üõ†Ô∏è DevSecOps Pipeline

### Security Analysis Workflow

1. **Code Quality Analysis (SonarCloud)**
   - Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
   - Code smell detection and quality metrics
   - Security hotspot identification
   - Code coverage analysis

2. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning (Snyk)**
   - Real-time vulnerability detection in dependencies
   - License compliance checking
   - Security fix recommendations
   - Continuous monitoring of dependency updates

3. **Automated Dependency Updates (Dependabot)**
   - Automated pull request creation for dependency updates
   - Security patch prioritization
   - Version compatibility checking
   - Update testing and validation

### Pipeline Configuration

The DevSecOps pipeline is implemented through GitHub Actions and includes:

**Automated Security Jobs:**
- **Snyk Vulnerability Scanning**: Continuous dependency vulnerability assessment
- **SonarCloud Analysis**: Code quality and security hotspot detection  
- **Dependabot Integration**: Automated dependency updates and security patches
- **Scheduled Monitoring**: Daily security scans at 3 AM UTC

**Pipeline Triggers:**
- Push to main branch
- Pull request creation
- Daily scheduled runs
- Manual workflow dispatch

See `.github/workflows/devsecops-pipeline.yml` for the complete implementation.

# FERI, University of Maribor, Slovenia

During my master studies (see [pospisilf/mendelu](https://github.com/pospisilf/mendelu)), I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the Erasmus exchange program at the University of Maribor, specifically at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (FERI)](https://feri.um.si/). This enriching experience allowed me to immerse myself in a different academic environment while exploring cutting-edge topics in computer science and artificial intelligence. The University of Maribor provided an excellent platform for advancing my knowledge in specialized areas that complemented my home university curriculum. Through this exchange, I was able to work on practical projects and gain hands-on experience with modern technologies and methodologies. The international setting also enhanced my cultural awareness and communication skills while collaborating with students from diverse backgrounds. This repository contains all the coursework, projects, and assignments completed during my time at FERI, showcasing the practical applications of theoretical concepts learned in each subject.

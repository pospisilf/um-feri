I have prepared a template in Java to help you get started with the first task. Your task is to implement all the missing code and solve all the specified
problems. The best way to test if the fitness function is correctly implemented is to call it with the global optimum x* and check if the fitness is the
same as f(x*). All information regarding the problems is available at the provided links.

The problems you need to implement are as follows:
